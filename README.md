This Semantic Container acts as an endpoint in the [DIP project](https://www.ownyourdata.eu/en/dip/) to accept data from participants in a survey. The counterpart on the Data Vault is the [oyd-sharing plugin](https://github.com/ownyourdata/oyd-sharing).      

Special feature:    
* **Email Sending**: send emails to a configured list of recipients (stored in the Semantic Container)

### Semantic Container
